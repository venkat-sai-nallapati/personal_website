		<p>Hello viewers, this is your writer Venkata sai. Frankly speaking my full name is Nallapati Lakshmi Vara Venkata Sai. I have a small family consisting of my hardworking dad, lovely mom and a intelligent + idiot brother. I am from a small town called Anaparthy. It's a town in East Godavari district. One of the most greenest and prosperous districts in the Andhra pradesh state. Even though I am born in a farther village, I grew up mostly in this village. From my kindergarden to matriculation, i studied there in one of the best and interactive schools called TAR school. Its not that far from my home, so i used to go by bicycle everyday. My school used to conduct cultural programmes, so that newer generation kids should not forget their culture and tradition. In my 9th grade, I was also elected as Student's Pupil Leader. Our job was too simple. For example requesting new books to library, conducting cultural and sports events. Finally in the year 2014, I completed my schooling with above 95%, which is second best rank in my town at that time. Then I joined a institute named Tirumala junior college, from a nearer city Rajahmundry. This college is located in the outskirts of the city. Sometimes I even get the feeling of jail when going into college. I did my pre-graduation there for two years.I scored above 98%. And with the training given there, I passed the AIEEE (JEE Mains) exam in the year 2016 and got into an institute of national importance named Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam.    </p>

		<p>I started my graduation in 2016. In <abbr title="Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam">IIITK</abbr>, I opted for Computer Science engineering (CSE). In general, its hard to stay away from home and live in other state. But i have mentioned earlier, that my intermediate college resembles jail. So its easy for me to cope up in a new environment. Thank God, i am free from that hell. In addition, the climate is kerala is really interesting. Its has a rainy and cold weather. But humidity is little high, which is a bit irritating. Coming to tourist places, they is greenery everywhere and pleasant. My friends and I also made a trip to Munnar, a tourist spot in kerala. Now lets talk about food. I dont really like the food in kerala, but i learned some new recipies and liked some new tastes. People are really helpful except a few who took advantage when we are in need. They also speak hindi, which discouraged me to learn malayalam. Now lets talk about my college.Its a transit college for a while. After lot of struggle and protests, we were able to see face of college. Our college is in a hilly area and the view from our college is really peacefull. Since I am new to the world of computer science, its really difficult for me to keep up. Then i slowly started to understand everything. I started making this website in end of fourth semester.
